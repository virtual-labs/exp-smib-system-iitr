## Procedure for the transient stability analysis of single machine infinite bus system:
<b>STEP 1</b>: Single line diagram of power system for Pre-Fault condition is displayed. Enter the values of Bus Voltage (V, pu), Mechanical Power (Pm, pu), Transformer Line Reactance (Xt, pu), Transmission Line 1 Reactance (X1, pu), Transmission Line 2 Reactance (X2, pu), Inertia Constant (H), System Frequency (Hz), Time Step (s), Fault Occurrence Time (s) and Fault Clearing Time (s).
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 2</b>: Click on 'Calculate'. 	
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 3</b>: The single line diagram of power system for Fault condition will be displayed. The Power diagram for Pmechanical, Pre-fault, During Fault, Post- fault, Load angle vs Time (Swing Curve) and Frequency Curve will be displayed.
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 4</b>: Refresh and change the Fault Clearing Time (s) to verify the Transient Stability behaviour of power system whether Stable or Unstable.
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> 
<b>Stable:</b> The system is stable if the load angle oscillates with finite bounded amplitude.
<br>
<b>Unstable:</b> If the load angle starts increasing monotonically upon the inception of a disturbance, the system is Unstable.
